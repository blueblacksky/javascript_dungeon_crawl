// Current code needs to be better organized and modularized. map.js and the three battle system related .js files.

// Need new .js file for NPCs and Events

// Need an NPC object prototype that will contain information about NPCs that the player can interact with. A new field in the maptile prototype will be needed that indicates which, if any, npcs are present (should be done with enumeration)

// Art needs implementation. Current build can be considered an alpha, very playable
